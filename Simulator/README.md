# DRONING Simulator

This repository contains a drone simulation project developed using the Tello library and Python. The simulation allows users to familiarize themselves with the Tello library and simulate drone movements along spatial axes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the simulation, make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `json`
- `time`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `easytello`

You can install these packages using pip:

```
pip install json time matplotlib numpy pandas easytello
```

## Getting Started

To use the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository by duplicating it. You can do this by clicking on the **Fork** button at the top right corner of the repository page.
2. Open the cloned repository in your preferred Python environment.
3. Run the `example.py` file to execute the simulation.
4. Modify the movements in the `example.py` file according to your requirements. You can customize the drone's actions by editing the provided movements.

Please refer to the comments in the `example.py` file for guidance on how to modify the movements.

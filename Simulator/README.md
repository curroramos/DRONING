# Autonomous Racing Drone Simulator

Welcome to the Autonomous Racing Drone Simulator! This simulator is designed to replicate the flight behavior and characteristics of the autonomous racing drone developed in this project. It provides a virtual environment where you can test and refine the control and perception systems of the drone before conducting physical tests.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the simulator effectively:

1. **Installation**: Begin by installing the simulator on your computer. Detailed instructions can be found in the [Installation Guide](#installation-guide) section below.

2. **Running the Simulator**: Once installed, launch the simulator by executing the appropriate command or opening the executable file.

3. **Simulator Controls**: Familiarize yourself with the simulation controls to maneuver the drone in the virtual environment. The controls and their corresponding keys or inputs can be found in the [Simulation Controls Guide](#simulation-controls-guide) section.

4. **Scenario Selection**: The simulator includes various predefined scenarios that simulate different racing scenarios and challenges. Choose a scenario that suits your testing needs and select it within the simulator.

5. **Simulation and Evaluation**: Start the simulation and observe how the drone behaves in the virtual environment. Evaluate its performance, including its maneuvering, gate detection, and navigation capabilities.

6. **Adjustments and Refinements**: Based on the simulation results, make any necessary adjustments or refinements to the control and perception systems of the drone. Test the modified systems within the simulator to validate their effectiveness.

## Installation Guide

To install the Autonomous Racing Drone Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Download the simulator package from the [official repository](https://github.com/your-repository-link).

2. Extract the contents of the package to a desired location on your computer.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the extracted folder.

4. Run the installation command specific to your operating system. For example, on Windows, execute `install-windows.bat`, and on macOS or Linux, execute `install-linux-macos.sh`.

5. Wait for the installation process to complete. This may take a few minutes.

6. Once the installation is finished, you are ready to use the simulator.

## Simulation Controls Guide

To control the drone during the simulation, use the following keyboard inputs:

- **W**: Move the drone forward.
- **S**: Move the drone backward.
- **A**: Move the drone left.
- **D**: Move the drone right.
- **Space**: Ascend the drone.
- **Shift**: Descend the drone.
- **Q**: Rotate the drone counterclockwise.
- **E**: Rotate the drone clockwise.

Use these controls to navigate the drone within the virtual environment and complete the designated scenarios.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or have questions about the simulator, refer to the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Ensure that your computer meets the minimum system requirements specified in the installation guide.

2. Check that you have installed all the necessary dependencies as outlined in the installation process.

3. Verify that you are running the latest version of the simulator. If not, update to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and enhancements.

4. If you continue to experience difficulties, reach out to the project team members responsible for the simulator (David) for further assistance.

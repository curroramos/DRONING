## Gate Detection using Conventional Vision

This repository contains files for gate detection using conventional vision techniques, specifically utilizing OpenCV for gate and obstacle detection.

## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

Gate detection plays a crucial role in various fields, such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and computer vision. This project aims to detect gates and obstacles using conventional vision techniques implemented with OpenCV. By leveraging computer vision algorithms, the system can identify and locate gates and obstacles in real-time.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To use this gate detection system, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. Make sure you have Python and OpenCV installed. If not, you can install them using the following commands:

   ```
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

3. Once the dependencies are installed, you are ready to use the gate detection system.

## Configuration <a name="configuration"></a>

Before running the gate detection system, you may need to modify the configuration based on your specific requirements. The configuration file can be found at `<path-to-config-file>`. Open the file and adjust the parameters as necessary. These parameters may include camera settings, image preprocessing options, and gate detection thresholds.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To use the gate detection system, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that your camera or video source is connected to your system.

2. Navigate to the cloned repository on your local machine:

   ```
   cd <path-to-cloned-repo>
   ```

3. Run the gate detection script:

   ```
   python gate_detection.py
   ```

4. The system will start capturing frames from the camera or video source and perform gate detection. Detected gates and obstacles will be displayed in the output window.

5. Press `Esc` to exit the program.

## Troubleshooting <a name="troubleshooting"></a>

If you encounter any issues or errors while using the gate detection system, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed correctly.
- Verify that the camera or video source is properly connected and accessible.
- Check the configuration file for any incorrect settings or parameters.
- Ensure that the lighting conditions and camera angle are suitable for gate detection.
- If the issue persists, please [create an issue](<repository-url>/issues) in this repository, providing detailed information about the problem you are facing.

Remember to include as much relevant information as possible when seeking assistance. This can include error messages, screenshots, or any other context that can help in troubleshooting the issue.

Happy gate detection!

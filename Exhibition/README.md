# Hand Detection and Drone Control

This repository contains files for hand detection and control of a drone based on the gestures detected on the hand using the webcam and the camera on the drone. The implementation utilizes the `mediapipe` library for hand tracking and gesture recognition.

## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

Hand detection and control are essential in various applications, including human-computer interaction, robotics, and augmented reality. This project focuses on detecting hand gestures using computer vision techniques and controlling a drone based on those gestures. By leveraging the `mediapipe` library, the system can accurately track the user's hand movements and translate them into commands for drone control.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To use this hand detection and drone control system, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. Make sure you have Python and the `mediapipe` library installed. If not, you can install them using the following commands:

   ```
   pip install mediapipe
   ```

3. Connect your webcam and ensure that it is functioning correctly.

4. Connect to the drone's camera through the appropriate network connection and ensure it is accessible.

5. Once the dependencies are installed and the camera connections are established, you are ready to use the hand detection and drone control system.

## Configuration <a name="configuration"></a>

Before running the hand detection and drone control system, you may need to modify the configuration based on your specific setup. The configuration file can be found at `<path-to-config-file>`. Open the file and adjust the parameters as necessary. These parameters may include camera settings, gesture recognition thresholds, and drone control mappings.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To use the hand detection and drone control system, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that your webcam and drone's camera are properly connected and accessible.

2. Navigate to the cloned repository on your local machine:

   ```
   cd <path-to-cloned-repo>
   ```

3. Run the hand detection and control script:

   ```
   python hand_detection_and_control.py
   ```

4. The system will start capturing frames from the webcam and the drone's camera simultaneously. It will perform hand detection and gesture recognition in real-time.

5. Based on the recognized gestures, the system will generate corresponding commands to control the drone's movements.

6. Observe the drone's response and adjust your hand gestures accordingly.

7. Press `Esc` to exit the program and safely land the drone.

## Troubleshooting <a name="troubleshooting"></a>

If you encounter any issues or errors while using the hand detection and drone control system, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed correctly.
- Verify that your webcam and the drone's camera are properly connected and accessible.
- Check the configuration file for any incorrect settings or parameters.
- Ensure proper lighting conditions and hand positioning for accurate hand detection.
- If the issue persists, please [create an issue](<repository-url>/issues) in this repository, providing detailed information about the problem you are facing.

When seeking assistance, provide as much relevant information as possible, including error messages, screenshots, or any other context that can help in troubleshooting the issue.

Enjoy controlling the drone with your hand gestures!
